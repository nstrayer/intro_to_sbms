## What am I selling?

### A Thing

`sbmR`: an R package to perform uncertainty-aware unsupervised clustering of graph data.

.pull-right[
### An Idea 

.center[
.iconed[üí≠]
]

Building an R package alongside a research project serves to strengthen both the package and the research.

# The Why






---

# Electronic medical records (EHR)

![:space 1]()

In an effort to make healthcare more efficient EHR systems have become common in the US. 

![:space 3]()
.pull-left[
`r fa('file-invoice-dollar')` While originally made for billing purposes there is still a huge sum of information that, with careful effort, _hopefully_, can be extracted for research.

]
.pull-right[

`r fa('search')` In this presentation I will focus on the subset of EHR pertaining to billing codes: ICD9, ICD10, and Phecodes.
]
![:space 4]()

![:centerPic 35](https://securecdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bigdata.jpg) ![:small 0.6]([image source](https://www.pymnts.com/data/2018/datatorrent-jeff-bettencourt-real-time-big-data/))



---
# Biobanks

![:space 6] 

`r fa('piggy-bank')` Some hospitals have repositories of biological samples that can be matched to their EHR.

![:space 8] 

`r fa('syringe')` Data could be anything from plain unprocessed-plasma all the way to full single-cell sequencing. 

![:space 8] 

`r fa('dna')` Here I will focus on plain SNP-chip readings, aka presence or absence of a given marker at multiple points on the genome.

# PheWAS

![:space 5] 

In an effort to extract information from these data the technique PheWAS was made.

![:space 8] 

![:borderedCenterPic 80](figs/phewas-paper-head.png)

## Concept
![:space 5] 

![:centerPic 90](figs/phewas-explainer.svg)

---

## The univariate problem

![:space 15]()

`r fa('hand-point-up')` PheWAS looks at one genotype `r icon::fa('arrow-right')` phenotype association at a time.



![:space 12]()

.pull-left[
`r fa('stream')` This gives us the multiple-comparisons problem.
]
.pull-right[
`r fa('project-diagram')`Also, does the world work like this?

# Bi or Poly-partite networks

# Why SBMs

.pull-left[
- Working with Electronic Health Records (EHR) data

- Questions arise like "who are these people similar to and why?"

- Tried Deep Learning
  - Lack of interpretability
  - Needed specialization for bipartite networks

- Needed method that acknowledges the limitations of the data.

# Why write a package?

.pull-left[
Graph-Tool in Python fits SBMs but...
- Lab uses R
- We're focused on uncertainty
- Needed to tweak underlying methods for bipartite networks etc. 
- Wanted to present at RStudio::conf

  __Looking into possible graph libraries__

  __Deciding to use Rcpp__
