# Electronic medical records (EHR)

![:space 1]()

In an effort to make healthcare more efficient EHR systems have become common in the US. 

![:space 3]()
.pull-left[
`r fa('file-invoice-dollar')` While originally made for billing purposes there is still a huge sum of information that, with careful effort, _hopefully_, can be extracted for research.

]
.pull-right[

`r fa('search')` In this presentation I will focus on the subset of EHR pertaining to billing codes: ICD9, ICD10, and Phecodes.
]

# Biobanks

![:space 6] 

`r fa('piggy-bank')` Some hospitals have repositories of biological samples that can be matched to their EHR.

![:space 8] 

`r fa('syringe')` Data could be anything from plain unprocessed-plasma all the way to full single-cell sequencing. 

![:space 8] 

`r fa('dna')` Here I will focus on plain SNP-chip readings, aka presence or absence of a given marker at multiple points on the genome.

# PheWAS

![:space 5] 

In an effort to extract information from these data the technique PheWAS was made.

![:space 8] 

![:borderedCenterPic 80](figures/phewas-paper-head.png)

## Concept
![:space 5] 

![:centerPic 90](figures/phewas-explainer.svg)

---

## The univariate problem

![:space 15]()

`r fa('hand-point-up')` PheWAS looks at one genotype `r icon::fa('arrow-right')` phenotype association at a time.



![:space 12]()

.pull-left[
`r fa('stream')` This gives us the multiple-comparisons problem.
]
.pull-right[
`r fa('project-diagram')`Also, does the world work like this? 
]

# Multimorbidity explorer

![:space 14]()

![:borderedCenterPic 80](figures/me_paper_abstract.png)

---
## What it is

Application that allows researchers to explore the results of PheWAS studies along with investigating individual-level data that produced those results using ![:colorText orangered](interactive visualizations.) 
    
    
```{r echo = FALSE}
network_data <- readr::read_rds(here::here('fake_network_data.rds'))
r2d3(
  data = jsonlite::toJSON(network_data),
  options = list(
    viz_type = 'free', 
    update_freq = 1
  ),
  width = '100%',
  height = '60%',
  script = here::here('js/network.js'),
  dependencies = c("d3-jetpack", here::here('js/helpers.js')),
  container = 'div'
)
```

---
## Why it is 

![:space 15]()

.pull-left[
#### `r fa('hand-point-up')` Interact with results 

PheWAS results are typically delivered with static plots and tables. ME allows researchers to interact with those results.

]

.pull-right[
#### `r fa('expand-arrows-alt')` Expand past plain associations

By giving researcher's the ability to look at the network behavior of genotype-phenotype associations, it can provide more nuanced insights from the data than a table. 
]


---
## How it is

![:space 4]()

`r fa('box-open')` Central package contains all the building blocks of a typical ME deployment.

![:indent]()  `r fa('js-square')` Visualizations custom built in Javascript.
![:space 5]()

`r fa('puzzle-piece')` Creating a custom app is an exercise in combining the neccesary components. 

![:space 5]()

`r fa('cloud')` Hosted on lab RStudio Connect instance running on AWS.
  
![:indent]()  `r fa('docker')` If more security is desired, Docker image is available.

# Changing how we ![:colorText orangered](model) these data
![:space 8]()

`r fa('project-diagram')` If visualizing the data as a network can help us understand them, why not model them as a network, too?
![:space 4]()

`r fa('level-up-alt')` Mathematical and statistical models of networks are a diverse and booming field. 
![:space 4]()

`r fa('frown-open')` Unfortunately, many of the methods sit on fragile methodological foundations.

![:indent]() `r fa('grin')` Luckily, a new model type has taken the stage recently...

## SBM formula

![:centerPic 100](figures/sbm-formula.svg)

---
## Bipartite expansion

![:space 2]()

In its basic form the SBM only works with a single type of node, but we have two (phenotype and patients)...


![:space 4]()


![:borderedCenterPic 80](figures/bipartite-sbm-paper.png)

![:space 6]()

`r fa('wrench')` To fix this we can add a constraint to the model to only cluster nodes of the same type.

![:indent]()  <img src='figures/bell-curve.svg' width = 40px/> This is equivalent to an infinitely strong prior on cluster 'types'.

## Statistical features


Model is fit in a bayesian manor

### Priors 
![:centerPic 40](figures/bayes.svg)

Priors are set on both the group/cluster structure and the edge counts between groups.

### Fitting

.center[
`r fa('ruler', size = 2)`
]

Metropolis-Hastings is used to fit model using MCMC

Very similar to how a dirichlet mixture model is fit

The BiSBM outperforms dirichlet mixture models even when the true generating distribution is dirichlet.

# Future directions

![:space 18]()

- Simulations!

- Turning into a semi-supervized method

- More battle-testing with real data

- Optimizing visualizations for information transfer
