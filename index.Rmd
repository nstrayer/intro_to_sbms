# Electronic medical records (EHR)

![:space 1]()

In an effort to make healthcare more efficient EHR systems have become common in the US. 

![:space 3]()
.pull-left[
`r fa('file-invoice-dollar')` While originally made for billing purposes there is still a huge sum of information that, with careful effort, _hopefully_, can be extracted for research.

]
.pull-right[

`r fa('search')` In this presentation I will focus on the subset of EHR pertaining to billing codes: ICD9, ICD10, and Phecodes.
]

# Biobanks

![:space 6] 

`r fa('piggy-bank')` Some hospitals have repositories of biological samples that can be matched to their EHR.

![:space 8] 

`r fa('syringe')` Data could be anything from plain unprocessed-plasma all the way to full single-cell sequencing. 

![:space 8] 

`r fa('dna')` Here I will focus on plain SNP-chip readings, aka presence or absence of a given marker at multiple points on the genome.

# PheWAS

![:space 5] 


In an effort to extract information from these data the technique PheWAS was made.

## Concept
![:spacePx 5] 

![:centerPic 70](figs/phewas-explainer.svg)

## The univariate problem

![:space 15]

`r fa('hand-point-up')` PheWAS looks at one genotype `r icon::fa('arrow-right')` phenotype association at a time.



![:space 12]

.pull-left[
`r fa('stream')` This gives us the multiple-comparisons problem.
]
.pull-right[
`r fa('project-diagram')`Also, does the world work like this?

# What about ...?

.pull-left[
- Questions arise like "who are these people similar to and why?"

- Deep Learning?
  - Lack of interpretability
  - Needs specialization for bipartite networks

- Need to acknowledge the limitations of the data
  - Use a model that fits the data

> [Non-SBM attempts] express implicit modeling restrictions and assumptions in their output... Stochastic block models have the advantage of explicitly stating the underlying assumptions, which improves the interpretability of the results.

# In a nutshell

.pull-left[

![:spacePx 100]()

Models the community structure of nodes by collapsing them into blocks

![:spacePx 70]()

Defines a probability distribution over all possible community forms
  - Therefor is a 'generative' model

# How they're fit

![:space 10]

- Most often used as a bayesian model
  - Uninformative priors on number of groups and group partitioning
  - Get uncertainty directly from posterior
  
![:space 10]

- Sometimes fit using expectation maximization
  - For edge distributions that don't have nice posterior formulations
  - Uncertainty usually not accessed but could be done through resampling techniques

# What exactly is `sbmR`?

.pull-left[

![:spacePx 90]

- Native R package (kinda)

- Fits SBMs

- Investigates uncertainty of found structure by sampling from bayesian posterior

- Provides (a growing list of) visualizations to communicate results
